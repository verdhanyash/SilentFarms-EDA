🌾 Farmer Suicide EDA (India)

Farmer suicides remain one of India’s most critical socio-economic challenges. This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of farmer suicide data to understand trends, regional patterns, and key factors such as literacy, income, rainfall, crop yield, and demographics. Using data-driven insights, the study highlights correlations that may guide policy, awareness, and further research.

📌 Features & Insights



✔️ Time-series trends – suicides across years


✔️ State-level analysis – identifying most affected regions


✔️ Demographic breakdown – gender & age group patterns


✔️ Socio-economic factors – income, literacy rate, NSDP


✔️ Agriculture & climate – rainfall, yield, temperature anomaly


✔️ Correlations & regressions – uncovering hidden relationships
